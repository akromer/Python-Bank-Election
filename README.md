# python_challenge

PyBank
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll
In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.


PyBoss
Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:

Import the employee_data.csv file, which currently holds employee records.

Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:

Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA

In summary, the required conversions are as follows:

The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.

The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.

The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.

The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
